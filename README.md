# Node_Weather_App

**A basic weather forecast app, built on the following APIs:**

 - [weatherstack](https://weatherstack.com/documentation) forecast API
 - [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/) geolocation API

Simply enter a location, be it a postcode, city or country. The **Mapbox** API will generate geocode which will, in turn, be passed to a request to the **weatherstack** API, which will return a reponse object with a forecast that is displayed on the page.
